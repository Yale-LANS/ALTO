\section{Portal Server Configuration}

After you have installed the Portal server, it must be configured for
your system.

There are two configuration files used by the Portal server:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{p4p-portal.conf}
\item \texttt{p4p-portal-intf.conf}
\end{itemize}

The Portal server will search for these files in the following directories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Same directory as the \texttt{p4p\_portal} binary
\item The \texttt{../conf} directory, relative to the location of the \texttt{p4p\_portal} binary
\item \texttt{/etc/p4p}
\end{enumerate}

The next two subsections detail these two configuration files.

\subsection{\texttt{p4p-portal.conf}}

This file controls general runtime options for the Portal server.  The Portal
server accepts a number of command-line arguments.  They can either
be supplied when you start the server, or you may specify them in the \texttt{/etc/p4p/p4p-portal.conf}
configuration file.

The configuration file is formated as a set of \texttt{name = value} pairs
such as the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
job-threads = 4
admin-txn-timeout = 20
daemon = 1
\end{verbatim}

You may view the list of available options by running the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ p4p_portal --help
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\texttt{p4p-portal-intf.conf}}
\label{subsec:portal-config-interfaces}

The Portal Server allows services to be exposed on different ports.  Ports may
either be defined for use by clients, or for administration purposes.
In particular, client ports expose the Location Portal and pDistance Portal Services to clients.
Administration ports expose specialized administration services that are used remotely
to configure and control a running Portal Server.
With such a setup, it is easy to provide network-level security
for the administration services via firewall rules.

The \texttt{p4p-portal-intf.conf} file controls controls which services are exposed,
and for each service, the port number through which it is accessed.
For example, you
may allow client services to be exposed on port 6671 and administration services to be
exposed on port 6672.  

Such a policy can be achieved with the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
[Admin]
type = REST
port = 6672
threads = 2
allow-admin = true

[Client-REST]
type = REST
port = 6671
threads = 4
\end{verbatim}

You may view the list of available options for each interface by running the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ p4p_portal --interface-help
\end{verbatim}
